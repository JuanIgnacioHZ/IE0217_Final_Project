# IE0217_Final_Project
Final project for abstract structures of data and algorithms course at the School of Electrical Engineering, UCR

Developed in Q3 2020, the code implements Huffman's Coding algorithm and it's respective data structures from scratch.

It can take a text and generate a coding key for all the characters in it. Then the user can input another text in order to get the binary representation of it. Finally, the program is able to decode apreviously generated output.

In order to run it, execute the following command on the repository folder:

`python3 Codificacion_de_Huffman.py`

The software was tested on Python 3.12.7 in a Linux (5.15.173) computer.
